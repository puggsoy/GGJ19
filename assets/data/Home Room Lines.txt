Congrats you got an item!
That's a cool looking item!
You should get more items.
Another run, another item.
That item looks interesting.
Another item! Cool!
That will make a good addition to your other items.
Another item...
Hmmm...another run?
Aren't you getting tired?
Your arms must be tired carrying all that stuff.
That's a lot of items.
These items are starting to pile up.
Where are you getting all these items from?
This place is starting to look like a mess.
Maybe you should try tidying this place up.
You've really got a thing for collecting.
Do you know how many items you've picked up?
It's getting hard to walk around in here.
Your home is full of junk.
It looks like you have quite a large hoard now.
Do you have a hoarding problem?
You do know these items have no effect right?
There is no scoring in the game.
There is no achievement for collecting the items.
Your character doesn't get experience or level up.
The only thing you're doing by collecting these item is increasing the junk in your home.
Let's face it, you're a loot hoarder.
Are you even reading these messages?
Congrats! You've filled your home full of junk! Now you can't leave.
